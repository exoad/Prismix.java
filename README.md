**Running from Source**

First read the specifications for environment requirements.

Specifications:
* Main Class: `pkg/src/com.jackmeng.prismix.jm_Prismix`
* Provided META-INF: `pkg/src/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`
* Class Path: `com.jackmeng.prismix`
* Required libs: `pkg/lib/*.jar`

**Using the prebuilt JAR**

The JAR can be downloaded from the desired released from the [`Releases Tab`](https://github.com/exoad/Prismix.java/releases). It is recommended that you download a *release* and not *preview*, *nightly*, *test* tagged releases.

To run this JAR, make sure you have the following environment requirements:
1. Java `17 or up` | [Adoptium Temurin](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/) | [OpenJDK SE17](https://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/17) | [Azul Zulu](https://www.azul.com/downloads/#downloads-table-zulu) | [Amazon Corretto](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-17-ug/downloads-list.html) | [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/#) | [OracleJDK](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwifsb_jwYmAAxWjFlkFHQHMDPUQjBB6BAgVEAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oracle.com%2Fjava%2Ftechnologies%2Fdownloads%2F&usg=AOvVaw0DKQD-JnLlas21toABBqtk&opi=89978449) | [JetBrains](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsRuntime/tree/jbr17)
2. A display (like a working monitor, something that can show pixels)
3. **Optional** but preferred: X (not Wayland)

### Linux users


**Using the prebuilt bundle**

> Note: X86-64 only!

This provides you with the necessary tools to run the program without worrying about setting up Java on your end. Just download, extract, and run `Prismix`.

## Usage

The program uses a YAML configuration which you can find after your first `run and exit` sequence under `./exoad/com_jackmeng_prismix_CONFIG.yml`. Here you will find the raw configuration.
